Hey, I am Matthias Himmelmann and I am interested in the various applications of algebraic geometry and data science. I am currently learning, how to use the programming
language `Julia` for mathematical modelling and visualization. From a theoretical perspective, I am learning about the algebraic sides of material science, especially
rigidity and catastrophe in tensegrity frameworks. If you are looking to collaborate, it is easiest to reach my via <himmelmann1@uni-potsdam.de>.
